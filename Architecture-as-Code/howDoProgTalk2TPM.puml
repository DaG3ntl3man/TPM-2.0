title How Programs Communicate with the TPM

actor "Application" as App

box "TPM Software Stack (TSS)" #F8E8E3
  participant "TSS API" as TSS
  note right of TSS
    - Provides a developer-friendly interface
    - Translates high-level API calls into TPM commands
    - Hides complexity from the developer
  end note
end box

box "Communication Layer" #E3D3C4
  participant "TPM Driver" as TPMDriver
  note right of TPMDriver
    - Handles TCTI communication
    - Implementation varies by OS:
      - Linux: Kernel driver
      - Windows: TBS service
      - Baremetal: Custom I/O driver
      - Software: IPC (Inter-process communication)
  end note
end box

box "Hardware Layer" #B85042
  participant "Physical Layer (SPI/I2C)" as PhysicalLayer
  participant "TPM (Trusted Platform Module)" as TPM
  note right of PhysicalLayer
    - SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
    - I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
  end note
end box

App -> TSS : Uses Developer API
TSS -> TPMDriver : Translates API to TPM commands
TPMDriver -> PhysicalLayer : Communicates via SPI/I2C
PhysicalLayer -> TPM : Direct hardware interaction
